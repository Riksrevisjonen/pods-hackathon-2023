## What we do

-   Use technology to improve the quality of audits
-   Improve detection of fraud and errors in financial accounts
-   Audit the use of ML/AI algorithms in the public sector
-   Participate in international data science collaborations

## Example I - Kielland disaster

## Problem statement

::: incremental
-   The school system is a central topic of political debate in Norway
-   Compared to other OECD countries we spend significantly more money
-   And yet Norwegian students often perform worse in the international surveys (e.g. PISA)
-   We would like to know more about the quality, efficiency and productivity in Norwegian schools
:::

::: notes
Debates: \* Constant debate on the lack of teachers (e.g. a significant drop in the number of applicants to become teachers) \* Long-standing discussion the fact that Norway performs worse than other Nordic countries on PISA-scores\
\* Requirements on the number of teachers per student (lærerernormen) \* A relatively recent rule that students will fail high school if they have too much absence in any single subject (fraværsgrensa)

:::

## Problem statement cont.

::: incremental
-   You will work with our R package `{noAPI}`
-   But we will also provide you with data!
-   Your job will (mainly) be to visualize and analyse
-   Please reach out if you have any questions
:::

## Assignment

::: incremental
1)  Use the [noAPI](https://riksrevisjonen.github.io/noAPI/) package to put together a dataset of all the currently active VGO schools in a single county.

2)  Familiarize yourself with the provided datasets for GSK and VGO schools. Combine the datasets so that it is easier to make comparisons.

3)  Create an interactive report or dashboard to visualize and analyze the data.

4)  Create an unsupervised model that clusters schools based on the performance and resource metrics provided.
:::

::: notes
1)  The first task is sort of a warm-up exercise. But we think it is useful for you to to familiarize yourself with how some of the school data was put together. And would also very much welcome feedback on your experience with the package!

2)  Most of the data is available for each individual school, both for GSK and VGO, but some of the data is only available at the county or municipal level. This is particularly the case for information on expenditure.

3)  The main task of the assignment. If you want to explore how to create a Shiny app that's something you could do, if not you could also opt for an interactive report. We know that Shiny is not covered as part of the course, but several visualization libraries (like plotly and ggplot2) are, and you will also learn how work with R Markdown.

4)  I understand that modelling is covered as part of this course, so if you have time would like you to explore clustering methods to identify groups of similar schools.

## Possible topics to expore

::: incremental
-   Qualitative differences between schools and changes over time
-   Aggregated comparisons of higher-level decision-making units, i.e. municipalities and counties
-   Comparisons of inputs (e.g. expenditure, teachers), outputs (e.g. number of students) and results (e.g. grades)
-   Geographic visualizations
-   Handling of missing data
:::

::: notes
:::

## Data

-   One list of datasets for VGO schools (ca. 500)
-   One list of datasets for GSK schools (ca. 2700)
-   Most data is available for each individual school, but some is only available at the county or municipal level
-   Can be retrieved from: \[SETT INN LENKE TIL GH-repo som vi lager for å dele data\]

## What we would like to see

-   Documented and version-controlled code
-   Data visualization done in R
-   Reproducibilty\
-   Creativity

## We are hiring!

-   New positions in The Innovation Lab will be advertised this fall
-   On a constant look-out for auditors with data science skills (e.g. R, Python, quantitative methods)
